# Idea for portfolio rework
1. Everything on one page
2. Show my interests in the background
3. Be creative and unique with it

# How to show my interests
I'm currently thinking of show:
1. Snowboarding
2. Video Games
3. UFC

The current thought is as the user scrolls down a person on a snowboard will be going down a mountain.  
It would transition to it all being contained within a screen and myself controlling said person with a controller.  
I then turn around, and I'm at a UFC event.

It starts out fully zoomed in on the mountain and snowboarder. As the user scrolls down the snowboarder travels down the mountain.
At the same time we slowly zoom out from the mountain. We start to notice a border around the mountain. Eventually showing
the person playing the game.
